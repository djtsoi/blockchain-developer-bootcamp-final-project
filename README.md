# **Rockstar Baby NFT**

As an avid NFT collector, as well as a music producer / DJ, I wanted to combine my passion and explore the NFT space. With the hype in the market, although some may say NFT's are a bubble, I believe that they are here to stay and will be a big part of our social digital identities.

# **Problem**

How does generative AI NFT's work? How can I combine art and code to create truly unique NFT's to people who mint them?

# **Solution**

Create and design a music NFT collection, where minters will get a combination of the following;

* Pixel Art Character (a baby) with unique characteristics and features
* Pixel Art Guitar

The minter could also try their luck to mint one of a handful of Rockstar Legends, comprising of pixel art (non-generative) characters of famous guitarists, e.g. John Lennon, Elvis, Prince, etc.

# **Example Workflow**

Rockstar Baby NFT Website
* Connect Metamask wallet
* Select mint and pay minting fee and gas fees
* Generative art would be created randomising pixel art layers through the smart contract
